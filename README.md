# Home Value Analysis
This project involves predicting property values using machine learning, specifically employing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression algorithm. The aim is to estimate the value of new single-family homes based on comparable sales data. By analyzing recent sales of similar properties, the KNN algorithm determines the nearest neighbors' average price to predict the new property's valuation.
