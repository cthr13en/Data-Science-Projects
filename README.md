# Customer Satisfaction Analysis
This project analyzes customer satisfaction survey data to gain insights into various aspects of the customer experience. The goal is to understand how customer satisfaction can be broken down into different attributes and how these attributes vary across demographic groups such as age, gender, and household income..

# Customer Survey Analysis
Customer Survey Analysis contains the code and data for analyzing customer satisfaction survey responses. The analysis aims to uncover common themes and concerns expressed by customers, segmented by their likelihood of recommending "The Company." By examining text responses, we identify key factors driving satisfaction and dissatisfaction, which can inform targeted improvements to services and customer experience.

# Home Value Analysis
This project involves predicting property values using machine learning, specifically employing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression algorithm. The aim is to estimate the value of new single-family homes based on comparable sales data. By analyzing recent sales of similar properties, the KNN algorithm determines the nearest neighbors' average price to predict the new property's valuation.

# Python Machine Learning with Spark
This databricks project aims to classify the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties using machine learning models. The dataset used is the Red Wine Quality dataset from the Vinho Verde region in northwestern Portugal. The goal is to predict whether a wine is of low, medium, or high quality by analyzing features such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol level.

# R NLSY79 Part A 
This project aims to analyze and clean height data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY) datasets, explicitly focusing on the years 1980-2004 for NLSY79 and 1997-2017 for NLSY97. The goal is to tidy and visualize the height data to ensure accuracy and gain insights into height distributions by sex. The project involves transforming the data from a wide format to a tidy format, addressing missing values and outliers, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize height distributions.

## Packages Used
- `tidyverse`
- `dplyr`
- `tibble`

# R NLSY79 Part B
This project explores the relationship between income and various physical attributes, focusing primarily on hair color, education level, and gender. The aim is to understand how these factors interact and influence income levels. The analysis includes summarizing income distributions by hair color, examining the effects of education on income, and investigating gender-based income disparities.

# R Predictive Modeling of Cancer Death Rates
This project aims to analyze and predict cancer outcomes using a dataset of cancer-related features. The primary objective is to develop and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately classify cancer types or predict cancer progression based on various clinical and biological features. This can help in understanding cancer patterns and potentially assist in early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning.
