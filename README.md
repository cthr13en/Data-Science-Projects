# Customer Survey Analysis
Customer Survey Analysis contains the code and data for analyzing customer satisfaction survey responses. The analysis aims to uncover common themes and concerns expressed by customers, segmented by their likelihood of recommending "The Company." By examining text responses, we identify key factors driving satisfaction and dissatisfaction, which can inform targeted improvements to services and customer experience.

# Home Value Analysis
This project involves predicting property values using machine learning, specifically employing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression algorithm. The aim is to estimate the value of new single-family homes based on comparable sales data. By analyzing recent sales of similar properties, the KNN algorithm determines the nearest neighbors' average price to predict the new property's valuation.

# Machine Learning with Spark
This databricks project aims to classify the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties using machine learning models. The dataset used is the Red Wine Quality dataset from the Vinho Verde region in northwestern Portugal. The goal is to predict whether a wine is of low, medium, or high quality by analyzing features such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol level.
